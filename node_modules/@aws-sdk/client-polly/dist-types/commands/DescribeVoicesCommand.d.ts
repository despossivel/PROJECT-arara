 * <p>Returns the list of voices that are available for use when
 *       requesting speech synthesis. Each voice speaks a specified language, is
 *       either male or female, and is identified by an ID, which is the ASCII
 *       version of the voice name. </p>
 *          <p>When synthesizing speech ( <code>SynthesizeSpeech</code> ), you
 *       provide the voice ID for the voice you want from the list of voices
 *       returned by <code>DescribeVoices</code>.</p>
 *          <p>For example, you want your news reader application to read news in
 *       a specific language, but giving a user the option to choose the voice.
 *       Using the <code>DescribeVoices</code> operation you can provide the user
 *       with a list of available voices to select from.</p>
 *          <p> You can optionally specify a language code to filter the available
 *       voices. For example, if you specify <code>en-US</code>, the operation
 *       returns a list of all available US English voices. </p>
 *          <p>This operation requires permissions to perform the
 *         <code>polly:DescribeVoices</code> action.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { PollyClient, DescribeVoicesCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-polly"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { PollyClient, DescribeVoicesCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-polly"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new PollyClient(config);
